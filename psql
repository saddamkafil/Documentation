# PostgreSQL Database & Schema Size Queries

## 1Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Total Size of the Current Database
```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(current_database()));
```
‚úÖ Returns the size of the currently connected database in a human-readable format.

### Get Size for a Specific Database
```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size('your_database'));
```
‚úÖ Replace `your_database` with the actual database name.

---

## 2Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Size of All Databases
```sql
SELECT datname AS database_name, pg_size_pretty(pg_database_size(datname)) AS size
FROM pg_database
ORDER BY pg_database_size(datname) DESC;
```
‚úÖ Lists all databases and their sizes in descending order.

---

## 3Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Size of All Schemas in the Current Database
```sql
SELECT nspname AS schema_name,
       pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_total_relation_size(pg_class.oid))) AS schema_size
FROM pg_namespace
JOIN pg_class ON pg_class.relnamespace = pg_namespace.oid
WHERE nspname NOT LIKE 'pg_%' AND nspname <> 'information_schema'
GROUP BY nspname
ORDER BY SUM(pg_total_relation_size(pg_class.oid)) DESC;
```
‚úÖ Returns the total size of all schemas, excluding system schemas.

---

## 4Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Size of All Tables in a Schema
```sql
SELECT relname AS table_name,
       pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size(relid)) AS table_size
FROM pg_stat_user_tables
WHERE schemaname = 'your_schema'
ORDER BY pg_total_relation_size(relid) DESC;
```
‚úÖ Replace `your_schema` with the actual schema name.

---

## 5Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Size of an Individual Table
```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(pg_total_relation_size('your_schema.your_table'));
```
‚úÖ Replace `your_schema.your_table` with the actual table name.

---

## 6Ô∏è‚É£ Get the Size of Indexes in the Database
```sql
SELECT pg_size_pretty(SUM(pg_relation_size(indexrelid))) AS total_index_size
FROM pg_stat_user_indexes;
```
‚úÖ Shows how much space indexes are consuming in the database.
